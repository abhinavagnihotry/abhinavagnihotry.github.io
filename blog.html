          <h1>Intel’s new High-Powered i9 processors</h1>
        </div>

          <p><h5>by Abhinav Agnihotry</h5><h3>Intel's Core i9 Extreme Edition CPU is an 18-core beast.</h3><br>
              The Intel’s rebranding might sound like a marketing hype, but it’s not. Intel’s Core i9 is the first consumer desktop processor to cram 18 cores and 36 threads into a single piece of “silicon” that enables the kind of throttled tasks that a world full of 4K video and virtual reality demands. <br><br>
          <img class="img-responsive" src="images/intel.jpg" alt="Intel Processors" style="width:70%"><br>
           The more cores and threads a single CPU contains, the more dedicated tasks it can manage simultaneously without sacrificing performance. Is an 18-core, 36-thread processor overkill for most people? Sure! But for the right applications, it could be a lifesaver.<br><br> Video and VR isn’t the only use case for Intel’s Rs. 1,10,000 ( $1700 ) monster. Compiling code and running intensive virtual reality experiences could use the boost. And the real benefit goes to those who need to navigate several interrelated tasks at once, like live-streaming video games on Twitch or YouTube. <br><br>
          There are 5 variants of the new processor line namely Core i9-7900X, Core i9-7920X , Core i9-7940X,  Core i9-7960X  and  Core i9-7980X starting from 10cores (20 threads) up to 18core (36 threads).<br><br>
          Recently a well known over-clocker who goes by the online handle Elmor managed to push the processor past the 5.7GHz using liquid nitrogen (LN2) cooling. This allowed him to set a pair of benchmark records in Cinebench, at difference clock speeds. Here is a look:<br><br>
          &emsp;• Core i9-7900X @ 5,755MHz: 3,181 points in Cinebench R15<br> &emsp;• Core i9-7900X @ 5,785MHz: 34.79 points in Cinebench R11.5<br><br>Those are the highest scores ever achieved for a 10-core processor, and the fastest outside of server setups. Just wait for the biggest 7980X chip to release as this was just the youngest sibling.<br><br>
           So no, most PC owners today won’t be able to take full advantage of an 18-core, 36-thread beast. But that’s not really the point. Core X exists less for the present than it does for the future, one in which “extreme” becomes normal, because there’s nothing else left.<br></p>

          <h1>Assassin's Creed</h1>

          <p><h5>by Praveen Agnihotry</h5><h3> World’s most famous action-adventure video-game franchise.</h3><br>
              Assassin's Creed is an action-adventure franchise which takes inspiration from the real-world historical events. The games in this series are set in different locations around the world and tell a fictional story about how the 'Assassins' and 'Templars' affected the history. The series basically depicts the conflict between two groups, the 'Assassins' and 'Templars'. The Templars desires the world peace through control while the Assassins believe in free will. <br><br>
          <img class="img-responsive" src="images/assassin.jpg" alt="Assassins creed" style="width:70%"><br>
          &emsp; Up until Assassin's Creed III the story revolves around the character Desmond Miles, who is being used by Abstergo Industries, to reveal the positions of powerful ancient artifacts left by the old civilization. Later in the first assassin's creed game it is revealed that Abstergo Industries is a templar organization and Desmond Miles is a descendent of assassins.<br><br> Abstergo industry uses the 'Animus' to bring out the memories of the ancestors of the one using it. When Desmond gets to know about that he runs away and finds the artifacts and the 'Apple of Eden' himself and later sacrifices his life to save the world from destruction. Later games in the series provide a story about the Abstergo industries' and how they obtain the ancient artifacts and assassins descendents oppose them. <br><br>
          Assassin's creed games are famous for their vast open world and storytelling with Assassin's creed 2 and Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag considered critically the best in the series.<br></p>

          <p><h5>by Tescoliving.com</h5><h3>Get out the door on time with a spring in your step using these quick and easy hacks.</h3><br>
              <h4>Hang your outfit the night before</h4>
              Attach an adhesive hook to your wardrobe door and use it to hang up the following day’s clothes, including all underwear and socks. Get into this evening habit, and you’ll easily save yourself a frantic 10 minutes in the morning rummaging through your wardrobe.<br><br>
              <h4>Wake up energised</h4>
              Wake up on the right side of the bed with the Sleep Cycle Alarm Clock app. Just set the alarm for a 30-minute window, and the soothing alarm sounds will only trigger during a light sleep phase so you wake up naturally and feel rested.
              Use it for more than a week, and you’ll begin to see graphs and trends showing sleeping patterns according to days of the weeks, the moon, weather and daily activity.<br><br>
              <h4>Time your morning shower</h4>
              Set an alarm on your phone for a maximum of five minutes to encourage you to quicken the pace. Multi-task by lathering up with body wash while you condition your hair or shave.<br><br>
              <h4>Organise your bathroom</h4>
              Have your daily showering essentials like shampoo, body wash and a razor at arm’s length away for maximum efficiency.<br>
              Try magnetic strips on your bathroom cabinet to store hair accessories, tools and cosmetics for quick and easy access. If you have a small bathroom, check out our tips for organising it with our clever storage hacks.</p>
